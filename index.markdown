subtitle: Building applied AI solutions through discipline and curiosity

I explore what’s possible with AI and pioneer new approaches that solve real problems with incredible teams. I am endlessly curious, love a challenge, and am amazed and excited that everyday I get to work in an industry that changes and challenges how we did things yesterday. I’m passionate not just about the technology, but also the endless possibilities it unlocks. I share what I learn to give back to the community that inspires me daily.
