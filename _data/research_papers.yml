- title: "Lightweight Safety Classification Using Pruned Language Models"
  description: "This paper introduces Layer Enhanced Classification (LEC), a novel technique that outperforms GPT-4o and specialized models in content safety and prompt injection detection using fewer than 100 training examples with dramatically reduced computational requirements. The approach combines the computational efficiency of a streamlined Penalized Logistic Regression Classifier with the robust language understanding of an LLM. The results demonstrate that incredibly small transformer models (0.5B parameters) are robust feature extractors for classification tasks."
